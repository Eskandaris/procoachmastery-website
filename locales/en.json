PCM will replace the null/voided provision with a provision that comes as close as possible to the purpose within the limits of mandatory law.\n\nArticle 3 – Target group, age and territorial availability\nThe Training is exclusively intended for Participants aged 18 or older.\nThe Training is not offered to persons with residence/stay in Germany. If an order from or directed to Germany nevertheless comes about (e.g. due to incorrect data or circumvention), PCM may cancel the order and block access. In that case, PCM will refund the amount paid insofar as legally required.\nPCM may (temporarily) restrict access in other countries if this is necessary to comply with laws and regulations or to prevent abuse, sanction risks or compliance risks.\n\nArticle 4 – Formation of the Agreement\nThe Agreement is formed as soon as Participant completes the order and payment is successfully processed (via Stripe or another payment provider designated by PCM), and PCM confirms the order or grants access.\nPCM may refuse an order or request additional verification if there is a reasonable ground for this, for example in case of suspicion of fraud, abuse, unlawful conduct, chargeback risk or providing incorrect data.\n\nArticle 5 – Content of the Training and no result guarantee\nPCM delivers an online coach training as described in the Offer.\nPCM delivers a best-efforts commitment and gives no guarantee on specific results (such as revenue, client numbers, certification, admission or professional outcomes).

If supervision or mentor coaching is required for an external trajectory (such as EMCC), Participant organizes this themselves.\n\nArticle 7 – Access and duration\nAfter payment, Participant will in principle receive immediate access to the Platform.\nParticipant receives access to the Platform and the essential components of the Training for a minimum of 3 years from the date of first access.\nPCM may terminate access after 5 years. After 5 years, the right to access expires, unless PCM explicitly extends.\nAccess depends on operation of the Platform by PCM. If PCM discontinues operation within the minimum access period of 3 years and cannot offer a reasonable alternative, PCM will provide an appropriate solution insofar as legally required (e.g. proportional refund for the remaining part of the minimum access period).\n\nArticle 8 – Support (human) and communication\nHuman support is included with both Training and Program, as described in the Offer.\nSupport is provided via info@procoachmastery.com and/or via the Platform. PCM strives to respond within 2 business days. This is a best-efforts obligation, not a guarantee.\nSupport is intended for questions about access, use and general training questions. Support is not medical, psychological, legal or financial advice.\n\nArticle 9 – Fair use and AI usage limits (hard stop)\nTo maintain quality, stability and costs, PCM applies a fair-use policy.\nPer Participant, the following applies (total over the access period), unless stated otherwise in the Offer:\nAI avatar: maximum 2,500 minutes total.\nAI total: maximum 5,000 minutes total (including AI avatar).\nUpon reaching the limit, the relevant AI functionality automatically stops (hard stop). Participant retains access to the other components of the Training within the access period.\nPCM determines the measurement method and records usage in logs.\n\nArticle 10 – Usage rules, prohibited behavior and enforcement\nParticipant uses the Training lawfully and carefully and refrains from behavior that may harm PCM, other persons or third parties.\nIt is prohibited (non-exhaustive):\nto share, lend, resell or make available to third parties account/access;\nto copy, distribute, publish, republish or resell learning materials, prompts, videos, audio, templates or AI output;\nscreen recording, recording or stream ripping of (parts of) the Platform, lessons or AI sessions;\nscraping, reverse engineering, security testing without permission, or circumventing limits/technical measures;\nintimidation, discrimination, doxxing, hate speech, threats or otherwise unlawful conduct;\npayment fraud or initiating an evidently incorrect chargeback.\nIn case of (suspected) violation, PCM may take measures, including warning, suspension, restriction or termination of access.\n\nArticle 11 – Use with real clients and data of third parties\nIf Participant applies the Training in coaching with real clients, Participant is themselves responsible for the coaching relationship, the content of the coaching and compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including privacy rules).\nParticipant does not enter personal data of clients or other third parties into the AI functionality, unless Participant is demonstrably entitled to do so and this fits within the privacy statement and applicable law. PCM recommends always anonymizing.\nPCM is not liable for damage that arises from the use of the Training or AI output in practice by Participant.\n\nArticle 12 – Certificate, assessment and human reassessment\nParticipant can receive a certificate if the criteria from the Offer/Platform have been met.\nAssessments and the certificate decision can (largely) take place automatically.\nParticipant can request a human reassessment of the certificate outcome within 14 days after the result. PCM may ask for a brief and concrete substantiation.\nPCM strives to complete a reassessment within 30 days.\n\nArticle 13 – External certification and EMCC (no guarantee, no liability)\nExternal certification/recognition (such as EMCC) is not part of the Agreement with PCM, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.\nPCM does not guarantee that the Training (now or in the future) meets EMCC requirements or that EMCC accepts an application.\nChanges in policy, criteria, interpretation, procedures, rates or recognition possibilities at EMCC (including a possible requirement that training must be provided by humans) do not constitute a shortcoming of PCM and do not give rise to compensation, price reduction or restitution, except for mandatory law.\nParticipant is themselves responsible for verifying current EMCC requirements and organizing any supervision/mentor coaching.\n\nArticle 14 – Prices, VAT/CRKBO and invoicing (secure)\nThe price of the chosen product is in the Offer and in the checkout.\nPCM is CRKBO-registered. PCM aims to apply the VAT education exemption where applicable. The VAT treatment may depend on (i) the nature of the service, (ii) the country of Participant and (iii) applicable rules. The checkout/invoice is leading.\nIf a tax authority or legislation gives rise to a different tax treatment, PCM can adjust this for future sales. For already concluded Agreements, legal consumer rights remain intact.\n\nArticle 15 – Payment, chargebacks and collection\nPayment is processed via Stripe or a payment provider designated by PCM.\nIf Participant initiates a chargeback/dispute, PCM may (temporarily) suspend access during the investigation.\nIf a chargeback proves incorrect or is decided in favor of PCM by the payment provider, PCM may charge reasonable administrative costs and demonstrable external costs (such as dispute fees), insofar as legally permitted.\n\nArticle 16 – Right of withdrawal (14 days) and refund policy\nParticipant has as a consumer the legal right of withdrawal of 14 days for a distance agreement.\nWithdrawal can be made within 14 days after concluding the Agreement by an unambiguous statement by email to info@procoachmastery.com. PCM confirms receipt.\nAfter withdrawal, PCM terminates access and Participant must stop all use of the Platform and Content. Any downloads or copies of Content may not be (further) used or distributed.\nPCM refunds according to legal rules and terms. If and insofar as the law permits, PCM may charge a proportional fee for services already provided if Participant has explicitly requested immediate execution.\nAfter the withdrawal period has expired, refund is not possible, except when mandatory law requires this (for example in case of non-conformity or other legal remedies).\n\nArticle 17 – Cancellation/rescheduling of planned contact education (only if offered)\nThis article only applies if PCM offers planned contact education (human sessions) and Participant books a time slot for this (whether or not as an add-on).\nCancellation policy by Participant:\nmore than 6 weeks before start: free of charge;\n6 to 4 weeks before start: 50% of the value of the time slot;\n4 to 2 weeks before start: 75% of the value of the time slot;\nless than 2 weeks before start or no-show: 100% of the value of the time slot.\nRescheduling within 48 hours before start may be refused or considered as used.\n\nArticle 18 – Intellectual property\nAll intellectual property rights on the Platform and Content rest with PCM or its licensors.\nParticipant receives a limited, personal, non-transferable right of use for own learning purposes during the access period.\nViolation (such as screen recording, copying/distributing or reselling) qualifies as a serious shortcoming. PCM may then immediately terminate access and recover damage and costs, insofar as legally permitted.\n\nArticle 19 – Privacy, retention periods and evidence\nPCM processes personal data in accordance with the privacy statement and GDPR.\nPCM may process, among others: account data, payment status, progress, scores, (parts of) transcript/AI interactions, feedback summaries and technical logs.\nRetention period: PCM retains relevant data in principle for a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 5 years after the end of the Agreement, unless a longer retention obligation applies or longer retention is necessary for disputes/claims.\nElectronic communication and logs from PCM can serve as evidence, subject to counter-evidence.\n\nArticle 20 – Liability\nPCM is not liable for indirect damage, consequential damage, lost profit or reputational damage, insofar as legally permitted.\nInsofar as PCM is liable, liability is limited to the amount paid by Participant for the relevant product, unless mandatory law provides otherwise.\nNothing in these terms and conditions excludes liability that cannot be excluded under mandatory law (such as liability in case of intent or conscious recklessness).\n\nArticle 21 – Force majeure and third parties\nPCM is not obliged to perform if there is force majeure, including (non-exhaustive) disruptions at hosting/LLM providers, network disruptions, cyber incidents, failure of payment providers or government measures.\nPCM may engage third parties for (parts of) the Training. PCM is not liable for decisions or policy changes of third parties, including external certification bodies.\n\nArticle 22 – Termination and suspension\nPCM may suspend or terminate access in case of (suspected) fraud, abuse, violation of these terms and conditions or unlawful conduct.\nUpon termination, access and usage rights expire immediately. Insofar as legally permitted, there is no right to restitution upon termination due to attributable shortcoming or unlawful conduct by Participant.\n\nArticle 23 – Applicable law and competent court\nDutch law applies to the Agreement.\nDisputes are submitted to the competent court in The Hague, insofar as a forum choice towards consumers is permissible. Participant retains legal rights to also submit a dispute to the competent court in their own country of residence if mandatory law so provides.\n\nAppendix 1 – Model form for withdrawal\nOnly fill in and return this form if you wish to withdraw from the agreement.\nTo: ICA Netherlands B.V., Tasmanstraat 131, 2518VM Den Haag, Netherlands, info@procoachmastery.com\nI/We* hereby notify* that I/we* withdraw/withdraw* our agreement regarding the Training.\nOrdered on*/received on*:\nName of consumer(s):\nAddress of consumer(s):\nSignature of consumer(s) (only if this form is submitted on paper):\nDate:\n* Cross out what does not apply."
